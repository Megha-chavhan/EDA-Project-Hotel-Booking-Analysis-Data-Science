# EDA-Project-Hotel-Booking-Analysis-Data-Science
In this project, we conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of hotel booking data. The dataset consisted of around 120000 rows and 32 columns, encompassing information related to hotel bookings. This included details on customer demographics, booking channels, reservation status, and other relevant variables. The primary objective of this project was to perform a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing hotel booking information. The aim was to gain valuable insights into booking patterns, customer preferences, and other relevant trends in the hospitality industry.

The project will employ a variety of data analysis and visualization tools, including Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The first objective is to clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure its quality and reliability. This includes handling missing values, outliers, and data type conversions, statistical measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles for numerical variables, Utilizing various data visualization techniques, the project will create plots and charts to represent the data visually, Investigating the relationships between variables, and hypothesis testing may also be used to draw meaningful conclusions from the data.

With this, we found that there is a positive relationship between the number of adults and the number of days in waiting list, and a negative relationship between the number of babies and the number of days in waiting list. This suggests that the number of adults in a booking is a more important factor in predicting the number of days in waiting list than the number of babies. Based on the findings from the EDA, we would suggest the client to focus on increasing the number of adults in their bookings. This is likely to lead to a decrease in the number of days in waiting list. We also found that the most preferred hotel is Hotel A, followed by Hotel B and Hotel C. We also found that the average number of days in waiting list is higher for city hotels than for resort hotels. This suggests that city hotels are more popular than resort hotels.

The EDA provided valuable insights into the hotel booking data, uncovering patterns, trends, and opportunities for optimization.
